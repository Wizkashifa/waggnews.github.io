        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>World Aggregate News, or just WAGG News for short, was born out of the idea that everyone should be able to access reliable news that they care about, without having to sift through long articles. World Aggregate collects news from hundreds of sources across the internet and around the world and compresses their stories into bulletins under 140 characters.</p>
        <p>We don't believe it is fair to take credit for the work of other organizations, and for that reason, all the news we share is attributed, unless it is exclusively ours. We also believe it's unreasonable to be biased, and as such we pride ourselves on showing all the sides of a store whenever possible.</p>
